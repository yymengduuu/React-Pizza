## 🚚 Delivery Timer Logic

A dynamic delivery countdown is implemented using `useRef` + `useEffect` + `setInterval` to simulate the time left until delivery.  
It updates every second and visually reflects when the order has been delivered.

```
const deliveryTimeRef = useRef(Date.now() + deliveryDuration * 60 * 1000);
```

---

## 🔐 Form Validation

- Uses required HTML attributes for basic validation.
- Custom validation added for UK phone number using:

```
/^\+44\s?\d{3}\s?\d{3}\s?\d{4}$/
```

---

## ➕ Cart Quantity Logic

- Users can increase/decrease item quantity in cart
- Quantity capped at 10 per item
- **+**button becomes disabled once quantity reaches 10

```
<button disabled={quantity >= 10}>+</button>
```
